Sullivan, chief of security, found the Great Man standing in front of the enormous window in his corporate office.
on the big glass-topped desk across the room, so that the Great Man was mostly in shadow, hands in the pockets of this
crisply tailored suit jacked as he gazed brood-ingly out at the skyline.

"Even in a book of lies sometimes you find truth. There is indeed a season for all things and now that I see you
flesh-to-flesh and blood-to-blood I know I cannot raise my hand against you. But know this, you are my greatest
disappointment. Does your master hear me? Atlas! You can kill me, but you will never have my city. My strength is not
in steel and fire, that is what the parasites will never understand. A season for all things! A time to live and a time
to die, a time to build... and a time to destroy!"

It was eight o'clock, and Chief Sullivan, a tired middle-aged man in a rain-dampened suit, badly wanted to go home,
kick off his shoes, and listen to the fight on the radio. But the Great Man often worked late, and he'd been waiting
for these two reports. One report, in particular, Sullivan wanted to have done with - the one from Japan. It was a
report that made him want a stiff drink, and fast. but he knew the Great Man wouldn't offer hime one.
